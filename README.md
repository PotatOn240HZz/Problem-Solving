# Problem-Solving

Starting in 2020, I started problem-solving on different websites and attended multiple contests.
This repository will contain some of the problems I solved in LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces. I couldn't include the rest of the websites that I use since I didn't find any scrappers on the other websites, nor could I contain the contests, exams, and interview questions due to the privacy policies of these companies.
